# Chapter 7

**Bhagavān Dattātreya continues:**

Upaniṣad-s explain how *māyā* projects objects as different things from Brahman (It is the *māyā* that makes us to think that the objects we see are real and different from Brahman; the fact is that everything is Brahman, hence It is called Omnipresent or all pervasive). Brahman is not divisible (hence omnipresent) and hence, there cannot be any comparison for a non-dual Brahman (comparison is possible only if more than one object is present). It is free from actions (hence It is called inert). When Brahman is indivisible, how can It be ritualistically worshiped? The intellect of Brahman is inexplicable (Taittirīya Upaniṣad says, “*satyaṁ jñānaṁ anantaṁ brahma*”.) It is neither vast nor minute. (Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.2.20 says, “Brahman is smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest.) There is no division such as day and night in Brahman. Brahman alone is Self-luminous and luminaries cannot illumine Brahman (Kaṭha Upaniṣad (2.2.15) explains this further. “In the presence of Brahman, the sun does not shine, nor do the moon and stars, nor does lightning, let alone this fire. When Brahman shines, everything follows. By Its light, all these are lighted.”) There is no desire or lack of it in Brahman (It is inert, as seen earlier). There is no structural changes in It. There is no beginning and end for It; It is eternal and preternatural. When Brahman is One, how there can be knower and known? It is indefinable. There are no different worlds (heaven, earth, hell, etc.) and no different gods such as Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva. (They are nothing but wild stretch of imagination; they are the characters of *purāṇa*-s; and result of our wild imagination.) Brahman cannot be classified as Puruṣa and Prakṛti. (In some texts, it is said that Puruṣa is Brahman and Prakṛti is It’s Power. But according to Advaita, there is no duality at all, like Puruṣa and Prakṛti or Śiva and Śakti. Pure Advaita does not accept anything except Brahman, who is all pervasive.) Brahman is not responsible for geriatric sufferings (body grows and perishes ultimately; there is no end for Brahman within, which is often known as the individual soul). It alone is imperishable (others are bound by birth, growth and death). There is no question of It being a man or a woman (beyond gender classification). When everything is Brahman, how can you use “I” or “mine” (these are used due to egocentrism) There is no merit or fault, bondage or freedom, worshiper and worshiped, pleasure and pain in Brahman, as It is beyond all dyads (and triads too — pure Advaita). It is wrong to think that one has a family as there is you and I in Brahman. There is no *guru* or disciple (both of them are Brahman). How is it possible to worship It (worship *guru*). All actions of life are illusionary in nature. When intellect cannot explain, how can there be any form (different forms of gods and goddesses; Brahman is devoid of forms and only due to spiritual ignorance or limited knowledge, we give different shapes and forms of gods for different purposes). An Avadhūta attains this stage, after seriously meditating and finally merging into eternal Bliss (Saccidānanda).
