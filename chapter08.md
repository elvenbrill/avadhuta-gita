# Chapter 8

**Bhagavān Dattātreya continues:**  

An Avadhūta, not worried about his clothing, traverses through a path that is free from both virtues and sins (non-duality). He always remains in perpetual Bliss. It is difficult to identify an Avadhūta, as he never exhibits his inner Self. There is nothing good or bad for him (non-dual), but he always remains pure (Brahman is eternally Pure and Blissful). He stays away from controversies. He is free from all types of desires (he does not build *ashrams* and empires). He renounces everything and stays in Blissful state always. He does not care for his body. When he exists in eternal Bliss, how can he offer ritualistic worship and to whom? For him, there is neither bondage nor liberation (no liberation because, he already remains with Brahman; he awaits the death of his body). There is no question of remaining with Brahman too, as he is beyond union with Brahman or separating from It (he is already Brahman Himself, the true “I am That”). He has no friends or foes. He may or may not follow *prāṇāyama* or *yoga*; still he remains only as a Yogi (here it means accomplished). When a person thinks that he is knowledgeable, then he is not even a *yogi*. When there is knowledge, there has to be ignorance (duality). Such persons are not liberated, as they are still deluded by duality. There is no death for him, as death is related to his physical body. An Avadhūta does not meditate, as meditation is a duality (he already remains with Brahman); what is the need for meditation for him? (But we must remember that he has reached state of Avadhūta after practicing meditation intensely and during his meditation, he purifies himself. Only a purified person can enter the state of Avadhūta. Only purity can join with Purity.)

He addresses this to Brahman “I am sorry for not seeking you through pilgrimage. I have not gone for pilgrimage because I know that you are omnipresent. I don’t meditate because, I cannot give you a form. For the same reason, I do not sing your praises. Please forgive me for this.” (In a nutshell, he explains pure Advaita). An Avadhūta is the one who has controlled his senses, soft in nature, pure in thoughts, without material wealth, no greed for food (he eats only to maintain his body), compassionate to all, impartial and is beyond any criticisms.

Now he explains the meaning for Avadhūta. “*A*” means that he is free from all impurities throughout his life and perpetually remains in Bliss (Saccidānanda). “*va*” means that he is free from desires and attachments. “*dhu*” means that his physical body is like a dust; he is devoid of body consciousness; meditation is not needed for him, as his mind is already pure. “*ta*” refers to his merger with Brahman. He is free from all types of dualities.
